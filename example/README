## README file to help in the execution of an example for GLOWgenes

GLOWgenes has been develop to be run in a linux computer. RAM of >32GB is recommended if full set of networks provided are used.

1. Check you have all required software and packages installed:
- Python 2.7 or 3.6
- Python packages:
    - numpy (tested with version 1.11.0)
    - pandas (tested with version 0.19.0)
    - scipy (tested with version 0.18.1)
    - sklearn (tested with version 0.0)
    - networkx (tested with version 3.0)
- R (tested with version 3.5.0).
- R packages: optparse, caret

2. Download network files from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/GLOWgenesNets_zip/21408393/1

3. Edit networks_knowledgeCategories.cfg file with your complete directory route to the network files
e.g. substitute PATH by home/pablo/GLOWgenesNets in every line, as in: /PATH/coexpressionCOXPRESdbEXT_HGNCnets.txt

You can use networks_knowledgeCategories.test.cfg with a subset of networks in order to reduce computational time for testing purposes.

4. Make GLOWgenes.py executable: chmod 755 GLOWgenes.py

5. Make sure your seeds file is:
- Composed by human gene names
- It is formatted as a single column plain text gene list or in a PanelApp format, check: https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/

This example directory contains two files with the same gene list with genes associated to Acute rhabdomyolysis disease (https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/1141/)

Acute_rhabdomyolysis.tsv - Grean and Ambar genes in PanelApp format: https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/1141/download/234/
Acute_rhabdomyolysis_onecolumn.tsv - Same genes but in a single column format

Both can be run and they produce the output provided within this directory

6. Use command line:
./GLOWgenes.py -i /PATH/GLOWgenes/example/cute_rhabdomyolysis.tsv -n /PATH/networks_knowledgeCategories.cfg -o /PATH/GLOWgenes/example

where:

-i indicates the complete path to the seeds file
-n indicates the complete path to the networks configutation file
-o indicates the complete path to the directory where you want the output

Other options are available in the documentation: https://github.com/TBLabFJD/GLOWgenes

OUTPUT FILES/DIRECTORIES:
GLOWgenes_prioritization_Random.txt
	- Main output file with the genes ranked according to their GLOWgenes predicted association to the seeds list.
	- This is a 3 columns file with: gene name \t integration score \t rank (1 is best associated)

GLOWgenes_trainingGenes.txt
	- List of seed genes detected by GLOWgenes

networkEvaluation.txt
	- Intermediary file with the evaluation of every network

bestnetsEvaluation.txt
	- Network selected for every Knowledge category


singleNetworkModeling/
	- directory with the ranked genes for every Knowledge category
	- Every file is a 3 columns file with: gene name \t integration score \t rank (1 is best associated)
